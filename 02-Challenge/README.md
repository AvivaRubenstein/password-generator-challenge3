# <Password-generator-project>

## Description

This project is a random password generator.  It collects information from the user about how many characters and which character types the user would like their password to contain, and then generates a random password made up of those criteria.  Through building it, I practiced prompting and alerting in the window through javaScript.  I also practiced using functions, Array methods, javaScript's Math object, and using conditional statements to ensure the correct results.
